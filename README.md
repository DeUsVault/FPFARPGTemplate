# FPF ARPG Template

The FPF ARPG Template is an Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG) project template created with Unreal Engine, featuring essential gameplay systems and AI-driven components. The purpose of this template is to provide a solid foundation for creating ARPGs while showcasing the potential of AI assistance in game development.

## Overview

This project is a result of a collaboration between a developer and an AI assistant, leveraging AI's capabilities to streamline the development process and implement various features more efficiently. The FPF ARPG Template includes:

- A comprehensive inventory system, including item management, equipping, and unequipping functionality
- Character stats and progression, such as experience, leveling, and ability points
- AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) using behavior trees
- Procedurally generated levels for infinite replayability
- Customizable abilities and skill trees for unique gameplay experiences

## Naming Conventions

All game-specific classes in the project are prefixed with a "G" (e.g., GInventoryComponent, GCharacterStatsComponent) to differentiate them and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

## Getting Started

To begin using the FPF ARPG Template, clone the repository and open the project in Unreal Engine. From there, you can explore the provided systems and components, as well as customize and expand them to suit your game's requirements.

We hope the FPF ARPG Template serves as an inspiring starting point for your ARPG projects, and that you enjoy discovering the creative and technical possibilities offered by this AI-assisted template.

## AI System

This project utilizes Unreal Engine's built-in **Behavior Tree** system for AI decision-making and planning. The choice to use Behavior Trees offers several advantages:

- Behavior Trees provide a powerful and flexible framework for creating complex AI behaviors.
- They are well-integrated with Unreal Engine, making development more efficient.
- There is a wealth of available resources for learning and implementing Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine.

The decision to use Behavior Trees was made after considering alternative AI planning techniques, such as Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP). Ultimately, the integration with Unreal Engine, support resources, and potential for more efficient development made Behavior Trees the preferred choice for this project.
