# FPF ARPG Template
The FPF ARPG Template is an Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG) project template created with Unreal Engine, featuring essential gameplay systems and AI-driven components. The purpose of this template is to provide a solid foundation for creating ARPGs while showcasing the potential of AI assistance in game development.

Overview
This project is a result of a collaboration between a developer and an AI assistant, leveraging AI's capabilities to streamline the development process and implement various features more efficiently. The FPF ARPG Template includes:

A comprehensive inventory system, including item management, equipping, and unequipping functionality
Character stats and progression, such as experience, leveling, and ability points
AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) using a goal-oriented action planning (GOAP) system for intelligent decision making
Procedurally generated levels for infinite replayability
Customizable abilities and skill trees for unique gameplay experiences
Naming Conventions
All game-specific classes in the project are prefixed with a "G" (e.g., GInventoryComponent, GCharacterStatsComponent) to differentiate them and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

Getting Started
To begin using the FPF ARPG Template, clone the repository and open the project in Unreal Engine. From there, you can explore the provided systems and components, as well as customize and expand them to suit your game's requirements.

We hope the FPF ARPG Template serves as an inspiring starting point for your ARPG projects, and that you enjoy discovering the creative and technical possibilities offered by this AI-assisted template.
